Hurricane Analysis
Python training project


Hurricanes, also known as cyclones or typhoons, are one of the most powerful forces of nature on Earth. Due to climate change caused by human activity, the number and intensity of hurricanes has risen, calling for better preparation by the many communities that are devastated by them. As a concerned environmentalist, you want to look at data about the most powerful hurricanes that have occurred.

Data collected on the 34 strongest Atlantic hurricanes are provided in a series of lists. The data includes:

-   names of the hurricanes
-   months in which the hurricanes occurred
-   years in which the hurricanes occurred
-   maximum sustained winds (miles per hour) of the hurricanes
-   list of different areas affected by each of the hurricanes
-   total cost of damage in USD($) caused by each of the hurricanes. For some of the hurricanes, damage data was not recorded 
-   total number of deaths caused by each of the hurricanes

This project consist of several functions that organize and manipulate data about Category 5 Hurricanes, the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed. Each one of these functions will use a number of parameters, conditionals, lists, dictionaries and string manipulation.
